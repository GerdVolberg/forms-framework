I work since 1992 in the Oracle Forms world at OPITZ CONSULTING Deutschland GmbH. After few projects I thought to myself: Why must I invent the wheel new in each project?

That was the rising of my Forms-Framework

In the first years the framework started with templates and a pl/sql-library. After many years of using Oracle Designer more and more OLB-techniques moved into the framework.

Using structured inheritances through object groups is now the main technique for all further development.
