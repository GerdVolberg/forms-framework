#summary How to use the Forms Framework

= Reference-Template =
== frw_ref.fmb ==

This is the central form of the Forms-Framework. All objects of the form-templates, form-modules and all menus are inherited from here.

All objects are bundled into object-groups. Those groups are inherited to the forms-template and from there they're copied into each form-module.


= PL/SQL-Libraries =
== frw_lib.pll ==

This is the [plsql_library_frw_lib main library] in the framework. All forms use an attachment to the frw_lib.

== frw_kit.pll ==
under construction


= Form-Templates =
== frw_template.fmb ==
