## About ##
This Oracle Forms Framework is designed for Forms Developer, who start creating a new application and need help in establishing style guides, templates and prototypes.

Long running projects which are in the maintenance-cycle can use the libraries to improve the functionality of the application

Forms-Framework is part of my Blog [Talk2Gerd](http://talk2gerd.blogspot.com/)
